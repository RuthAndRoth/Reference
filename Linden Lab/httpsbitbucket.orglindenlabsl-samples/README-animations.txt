Animations in the internal "anim" format
========================================

Note that the "anim" format is specific to Second Life and is not related to any other animation formats that may use the same naming convention.

* _bento_randomize_bones_and_attachments.anim_: For all bones and attachment points in the bento skeleton, move them through a collection of random positions. This will leave the avatar in a highly distorted state at the end.
* _bento_reset_bones_and_attachments.anim_: For all bones and attachment points in the bento skeleton, move them to their default positions. This should un-scramble the effects of the randomize animation above.
