### Note

Ada Radius has removed the resources mentioned below as they are now dated. The .blend file in this directory includes her latest armature.

### Armatures
 I've removed armatures, except for the one built from avatar_skeleton.xml as I'm working on upgrades that:
*try to find another solution to the Maya to Blender incompatibilities - the bone asymmetries and tail to head mismatches for the connected bones
*include information from avatar_lad.xml - the female to male morph 

### Other Resources

* SLAvatar.blend - replica of the inworld default avatar mesh, based on SLWiki downloads. 

* opensim_armatures.ods - spreadsheet analysis of avatar_skeleton.xml, which is found in the viewer Character folder. Cross-referenced to SLWiki information (some of which is wrong), calculations converting the Maya values to Blender, and notes on exporting from Blender. - THIS HAS BEEN REMOVED - updating

* UVmaps - PNG images.

* SLAvatarUVMaps.psd - PhotoShop document of UV Maps.
