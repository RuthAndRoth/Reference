### Note

Updates

### Armatures
 I've removed armatures, until I have one that works in more recent versions of Blender, probably the most recent LTS version.

### Other Resources

* opensim_SL_armature.ods - analysis of the default viewer armature, cross referenced to the Appearance sliders, and other information. 

* OSSLViewerFemaleSymmetrized.blend - a devkit for the Blender replica of the default viewer avatar, with some viewer errors fixed to make it less annoying to work with. This still needs more work - research into vertex weights for the skirt, for example, and decisions on what to do with the overlapping UV faces in the hands. 

* UVmaps - PNG images. These are derived from the above devkit, symmetrized to make them easier to work with.
